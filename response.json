The 'PRODUCT:MATNR' key mapping is used to match entries between the target table and the source tables.\n\n1. **Check MARA_500:**\n   - Match entries from the target table (PRODUCT) to the MARA_500 table (MATNR) using the key mapping. Since the current target table state is known, the transformation will check if 'RM120', 'RM28', 'RM129', 'RM20', and 'RM128' exist in MARA_500.MATNR.\n   - IF a matching entry is found, retrieve the value of MEINS from MARA_500 and insert it into the target table.\n\n2. **Check MARA_700 (if not found in MARA_500):**\n   - IF no matching entry is found in MARA_500, match entries from the target table (PRODUCT) to the MARA_700 table (MATNR) using the key mapping.\n   - IF a matching entry is found, retrieve the value of MEINS from MARA_700 and insert it into the target table.\n\n3. **Check MARA (if not found in MARA_700):**\n   - IF no matching entry is found in MARA_700, match entries from the target table (PRODUCT) to the MARA table (MATNR) using the key mapping.\n   - IF a matching entry is found, retrieve the value of MEINS from MARA and insert it into the target table.",
