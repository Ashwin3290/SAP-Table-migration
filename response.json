If no match is found in either MARA_500 or MARA_700, retrieve the corresponding material type (MTART) from the MARA table and insert it into the target table.\n\nIn essence, the transformation prioritizes MARA_500, then MARA_700, and finally MARA as the source for the material type (MTART) based on the existence of matching material numbers (MATNR) with the PRODUCT field in the target table.",
