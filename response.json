  "transformation_logic": "The transformation logic involves retrieving the Unit of Measure (MEINS) for materials based on a hierarchical lookup in different MARA tables. The logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **First Lookup**: Check for the material number (MATNR) in the MARA_500 table. If a matching entry is found, retrieve the corresponding Unit of Measure (MEINS) from MARA_500 and populate the target table's MEINS field.\n\n2.  **Second Lookup (Fallback)**: If no matching entry is found in MARA_500, check for the material number in the MARA_700 table. If a match is found, retrieve the Unit of Measure (MEINS) from MARA_700 and populate the target table's MEINS field.\n\n3.  **Third Lookup (Final Fallback)**: If no matching entry is found in either MARA_500 or MARA_700, retrieve the Unit of Measure (MEINS) from the standard MARA table and populate the target table's MEINS field.\n\nIn summary, the transformation prioritizes MARA_500, then MARA_700, and finally MARA for retrieving the unit of measure for a given material."
